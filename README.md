- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @mikegontarek

- ðŸ‘€ I am looking to land my first job as a Software Engineer. I am looking to use the Java skills I have built while in school.  Java is the language that I am most comfortable with and know that it works directly in mobile application development.  I started school because I wanted to build an app one day.  I am looking to find a company that will see the potential I have and take the chance on a recent graduate.  I work my tail off and am excited to make mistakes and learn from those mistakes.  

- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently working on algo expert problems and taking more time to focus on Java.  I am a full-time student that has a full time job and two kids. 
My course work consists of two classes for 8 weeks at a time and then two more for 8 weeks and a week off.  I do not get much time to experiment and am taking 
time as I get it wrapping up my degree to learn as much as I can about java. 

- ðŸ“« How to reach me ...
