ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @mikegontarek

- ðŸ‘€ I am looking to land my first job as a Software Engineer.  I am looking to find a company that will see the potential I have and take the chance on a recent graduate.  I work my tail off and am excited to learn more and learn from mistakes along the way.  

- ðŸŒ±I finished my course work to earn my degree.  I am waiting for my official graduation in December.  I had a 3.60 GPA through my major of computer science with an emphasis in software engineering.  While looking for work I am using Udemy courses to sharpen my skills and create some new Java and JavaScript applications.
