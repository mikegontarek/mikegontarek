ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @mikegontarek

- I am a recent graduate from Southern New Hampshire University.  I graduated Cum Laude with my degree in Computer Science with an emphasis in software engineering.  I achieved a GPA of 3.60 while helping my wife raise two little girls and working full-time in retail sales.  I am one of the hardest workers most people have met.  My passion to master things is what makes me a valuable asset.
