- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @mikegontarek

- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in Java and mobile application right now.  I am looking to land my first job as a Software Engineer.  I am open to other technologies, Java is
the language I am the most comfortable with currently.  My favorite class used Java to create a mobile application.  

- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently working on algo expert problems and taking more time to focus on Java.  I am a full-time student that has a full time job and two kids. 
My course work consists of two classes for 8 weeks at a time and then two more for 8 weeks and a week off.  I do not get much time to experiment and am taking 
time as I get it wrapping up my degree to learn as much as I can about java. 

- ðŸ“« How to reach me ...
